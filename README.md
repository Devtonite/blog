## ðŸ‘‹hello

My name is <a href="https://illya.sh">Illya</a>. I'm entreperneur and engineer. I develop products that disrupt how we think and interact with money and empower our digital privacy. This blog serves as a platform for me to articulate my thoughts on blockchain, DeFi, Zero-Knowledge cryptography, AI and finance. Here, I aim to merge deep technical concepts with practical applications.
